# Machine Learning Internship Project: Movie Recommendation System

This project is part of a machine learning internship and involves the development of a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.

## Description

The movie recommendation system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their ratings and preferences. It utilizes collaborative filtering, which analyzes user ratings to identify similar users and suggest movies that they have rated highly. The system aims to improve user engagement and satisfaction by suggesting relevant and interesting movies.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI: The recommendation system includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. Users can easily enter the name of a movie and rate it on a scale of 1 to 5.

- Collaborative Filtering: The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to calculate similarity scores between users and identify movies that other similar users have rated highly.

- Dynamic Recommendations: After submitting a movie rating, a new window opens automatically, displaying a list of recommended movies based on the user's ratings and preferences.
